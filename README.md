# ToDoScheduler

- Not a to-do list

- But help you **Schedule** your to-do list

- All you need to do is input the **deadline**, estimate the **time cost**, and add the task

- ToDoScheduler would split tasks into time slices and arrange them to suitable time slots, following pre-set rules and your preferences

- Great for situations when ddls overstocking, or during final weeks, or anytime you find it difficult to appropriately arranging tasks and ensuring there being no conflicts
